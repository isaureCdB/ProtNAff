create_database/3dna_parse_json.py  is compatible with versions of x3dna until 2018oct09.
At that date, the output format (atoms codes) of x3dna was changed.

There is no option (yet) to select non-redundant structures.
This can biase the statistics made on the databse/library.

_ Add entries in the structure.json file: organism, protein family, RNA type,
SCOP domains ...
_ Extract more 2D structure types from x3dna output (bulges, loops)
_ Extract NA-protein stackings
