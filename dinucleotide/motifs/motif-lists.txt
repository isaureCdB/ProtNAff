AA12.list comes from aptamers, except 7MLX and 8DP3 (which are both AA1 and AA2)
AC1.list comes from Pumilio, except 1F7U and 1F7V, which are tRNA synthetase
AC2.list comes from sex-lethal (2x), Lin28A-let (4x) and Ybox protein (2x) (it includes 1B7F).
   UPDATE: Although 4QQB contains sex-lethal, the protein that interfaces with RNA is NOT sex-lethal.
   Instead, it contains a cold-shock domain, like the Ybox structures and Lin28A.
CA1.list has a wide diversity (UPDATE: not really, it is all the U1A spliceosomal protein...)
CA2456.list comes from Pumilio, except 1RGO (CA2,CA5) and 4M59/4OE1 (CA2,CA5,CA6)
CA3 is specific for Cas9

CA1 (68 members) and AC2 (8 members) are the interesting ones. UPDATE: only AC2
CA1 is present in ~3-4 % of all RNA-binding PDBs, AC2 in ~0.5%
The CA1 dinucleotide conformer is 80-90% specific for double stacking
For AC2, it is more like 15%.
