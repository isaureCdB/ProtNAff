Can be inferred from unbound: 0.182 A in 3SXL (3sxl_dom2.npy A TYR 214 PHE 256)

(This is also true for a cold-shock domain:

Analysis at the seqsig level: (sequence signature: 15 residues + 15 residues surrounding the stacking aromatics)
    80 % sequence identity for redundancy, gap-nongap counts as half an identity

There are 70 unique RRM domains in the ProtNAff PDB list  (1819 PDBs)

    22 domains have no double aromatics (Phe/Tyr/Trp/His), 
    41 domains have (n, n+1) stacking
        Those 41 domains have 32 unique seqsigs.

    7 domains (minus 1) have double aromatics but NOT (n,n+1) stacking 
    (seqsig-vs-master-aligment). These are true negatives 

true negatives: 

P11940 domain 1: 1CVJ, 4F02  (domain 2 has double stacking, domain 3 is not in the PDB)
  domain 1 double-stacks, but n-n+2
Q99383 domain 1 and 2: 2CJK, 2KM8 (NMR structures)
Q8I3T5: 2N7C (NMR structure)
Q4G0J3: 4WKR (La domain)
P05455: 1YTY, 1ZH5, 2VOD. 2VON, 2VOO, 2VOP (La domain)
Q00425 domain 1: 6FQR, 6GX6

These true negatives are 7 domains (but 1 is not in PDB) => 6. 


For the 32 unique RRM seqsigs, look at instance with closest RMSD:

<0.2A: 5 of them, 0 other true positives, 11 incorrect. No non-stacking RRM.
    Includes Sxl itself at 0.086 A (different hit than 1B7F chain A)


<0.3A: 16 of them, 1 other true positive, 47 incorrect, of which 3 non-stacking RRM
    non-stacking RRM are P05455 (0.244 A, La domain) and Q8I3T5 (0.276 A) and Q99383 domain 1 (0.299 A)
    Other true positive is RRM7 (2MKK)

<0.4A: 26 of them, 2 other true positives, 145 incorrect, of which 4 non-stacking RRMs
    new non-stacking RRM:Q99383 domain 2 (0.330 A)
    new TP: 1C0A/1IL2, OB-fold nucleic acid binding domain (0.317 A) (ASPARTYL-TRNA SYNTHETASE)

<0.5A: 31 (out of 32) of them, 8 other true positives, 277 incorrect, of which 4 non-stacking RRM
    Missing out: 2KM8 A RA 9 RU 10 B TYR 29 PHE (0.921 A)
    Of the 6 new TP:
    
    Cold-shock domain 1 of B7Z0E2 is found at 0.429 A
    (RNA-binding protein Unr, 4QQB chain Y Phe 31 Phe 20) 
    
    Cold-shock domain of Q8K3Y3 is found at 0.429 A
    (Lin-28 homolog, 3TRZ/3TS0/3TS2/5UDZ chain U Phe 73 Phe 55)

    2MKI: RRM7 domain

    Cold-shock domain of P67809 is found at 0.451 A
    (YB1 protein, 5YTS[/T/V/X],6A6J[/L],6KTC,6KUG,7F3I[/J/K/L])
    Phe 85 - Phe 74 or Phe 65 - Phe 54 or Phe 35 - Phe 24 or Phe 120 - Phe 109 

    Cold-shock domain of P32081 (3PF4 chain B, Phe 27 Phe 17) is found at 0.460 A
    Cold shock protein CspB
    (note: in 3PF4, there is another double stacking Phe 17 Trp 8, this is at 0.587 A. 4QQB doesn't have it.)

    Cold-shock domain 7 of B7Z0E2 is found at 0.471 A
    7ZHH, chain A, Phe 34 Phe 23

Q4G0J3 and P11940 domain 1 (1CVJ) are beyond 0.5 A (0.512 A and 0.571 A).
That covers all false negatives, because P11940 domain 2 is not in the PDB.

========================

Structural discrimination of binding and non-binding: inconclusive.
overall: 32 vs 6  (84 %)
< 0.5A, 31 vs 4   (89 %)
> 0.5A, 1 vs 2    (33 %)

No significant lower RMSD value for stacking RRMs (Mann-Whitney U, p=0.18 one tailed).
Removing the 32th RMSD doesn't change things.

***TODO1: To investigate bias for double-stacking RRMs in the PDB:***
ProtNAff PDB has 35/38 double-aromatic domains within 0.5 A of 1B7F Tyr214-Phe256.
To be precise: for 35/38, there is at least one such instance in the ProtNAff PDB


(1) Getvalues for *all* instances. Check that stdev/max are not too high for the 35.
    In that case, unbound prediction works, since many instances are in fact unbound.
    (Combine with anecdotal evidence above)
(2) Investigate this on AlphaFold models of the same domains:
    Similar (inconclusive) separation between the 32 and the 6?
(3) Investigate this on a random subset of AlphaFold models of double-aromatic RRMs,
  with a sequence identity matrix histogram similar to the 32 and 7.
    Similar partitioning (35 vs 3) for <0.5A and >0.5A?

If (1) is true and (2) is true and (3) is false (more >0.5A, i.e. PDB has bias), then running the search
on the entire AlphaFold proteome is useful. 
If not, considering all double-aromatic RRMs to be double stacking is the best we can do.
****************

TODO2 (DONE):
Run the same analysis on n-n+2 stacking, using 1CVJ (P11940) 13-82 as an example.

XOX stacking is more rare, with 764 instances instead of 4046 for XX (n - n+1).
PABP (1CVJ) is the only RRM that has it.

A search against PABP (1CVJ 13-82) finds only itself, and one remote hit at 0.97A.
False positives is: nothing <0.2A, 7 <0.3A, 37 <0.4A, 115 <0.5A.
False positive RRMs is: nothing <0.2A, 2 <0.3A, 12 <0.4A, 23 <0.5A. 
Among the 7 false positives <0.3A, only the 2 RRMs do double-stacking.
Conclusion: no evidence to detect XOX from structure, at least not using 1CVJ.

/TODO2

TODO3:
Show that a dendrogram of seqsig identity or overall sequence identity does not capture stacking or non-stacking

TODO4 (for other paper):
Analysis on the RNA side, show that cold shock domains dinuc are <1A of 1B7F dinuc,

Use camembert result (camembert-dinucleotide.out, motifs/AC2.list):
For dinucleotide AC, 1B7F is close to around 20 double-stacking dinucleotides in 8 PDBs.
Those PDBs are cold-shock domains and NOT RRMs!

In general the binding mode is not conserved (unlike Pumilio), with >1A confs.
