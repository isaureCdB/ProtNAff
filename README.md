# ProtNAff
Create filters to select Protein - Nucleic acids structures from PDB files, and build libraries of protein-boud RNA fragments

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ProtNAff is a pipeline to:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Clean-up and parse all NA-protein structures from the PDB into ensembles of small information units in a single file

2. Search for sets of NA-protein structures with highly cutomisable combinations of criteria

3. Create RNA/DNA 3D fragment libraries extracted from those sets of structures.

4. Perform statistics on customised features of such libraries

1 is the necessary first step, 2 and 3 can be done independantly, 4 must be done after 3.
The output of 1 for the PDB at a certain time will soon be downloadable from the LORIA website, allowing to do directly 2 and/or 3(+/-4) directly.

The main idea of ProtNAff is to provide a highly versatile pipeline to cover as many usages as possible.
This is intended to be a dynamic collaborative work:

_ If you need a specific feature that you can't find or don't know how to add in the current pipeline, please contact us, and we will do our best to include it!

_ If you added some feature that you think can be useful to others, please fill free to propose a pull request.
